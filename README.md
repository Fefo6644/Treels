# Treels Engine
Formerly, just me testing things in the Windows API (following the online documentation).

Now I decided to code from scratch a little 2D graphics (""GAME"") engine, with wrappers and whatnot.

I decided to upload this to GitHub because something was broken, and I changed something and suddenly, the project worked! (though to my eyes it was exactly the same code).
