# WinAPI
Just me testing things in the Windows API (following the online documentation).

I decided to upload this to GitHub because something was broken, and I changed something and suddenly, the project worked! (though to my eyes it was exactly the same code).


# Objs
I was trying to implement (yeah, it's horrible) Windows Controls to a library, to programmatically control the controls, and not just use resource scripts.
