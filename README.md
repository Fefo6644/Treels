# Treels Engine
Formerly, just me testing things in the Windows API (following the online documentation).

Now I decided to code from scratch a little 2D graphics engine, with wrappers and whatnot.

I decided to upload this to GitHub because something was broken, and I changed something and suddenly, the project worked! (though to my eyes it was exactly the same code).



# Treels

This is the main objective of this entire project.

Treels is a DirectX 2D graphics engine library, that manages to wrap and hide all of the complex work that happens behind the scenes of an animation, a game, or a simple programatically made image, and enables the programmer to use this library without having to care about the graphics initialization, window management, event handling, etc., and simply display on screen the objective they have in mind.



# Application

This project is a testing environment, not being part of the Treels library.

It's meant to show and display a usage example of the Treels library.
