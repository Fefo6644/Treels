# Treels

This is the main objective of this entire project.

Treels is a DirectX 2D graphics engine library, that manages to wrap and hide all of the complex work that happens behind the scenes of an animation, a game, or a simple programatically made image, and enables the programmer to use this library without having to care about the graphics initialization, window management, event handling, etc., and simply display on screen the objective they have in mind.
